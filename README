wwwVisitLog
-----------

wwwVisitLog is an app to log all articles that I read from the internet. 
This would include random news, tutorials etc. This is an effort to make web
surfing more useful by writing  & storing a short summary about every decent
sized article that I read.

HOWTO:
------
To submit a new article, make a GET request as in the following example:
    http://localhost:8080/store?title=hi&url=acd.com&summary=sampleSummary2

To retrieve all stored articles, simply go to the homepage
    http://localhost:8080

I followed the Node Beginner eBook(http://www.nodebeginner.org/) to set up Node
webserver. Thanks to the author for writing this excellent book.
