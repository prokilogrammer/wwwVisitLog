wwwVisitLog
-----------

wwwVisitLog is an app to log all articles that I read from the internet. 
This would include random news, tutorials etc. This is an effort to make web
surfing more useful by writing  & storing a short summary about every decent
sized article that I read.

webserver. Thanks to the author for writing this excellent book.
